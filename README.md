# :wave: Hey! I’m Michael

### :alien: About Me
---
I'm currently a Computer Science student at Purdue University, set to graduate in May 2026. <br/>
I'm very passionate about exploring the applications for software through coding, in both technical and non-technical areas. <br/>
<br/> 
Outside of software development, I enjoy:
- Playing basketball 🏀
- Playing golf ⛳
- Hanging out with friends :beers:
- Watching movies 🎥
- Going to the gym 🏋️

:zap:Fun Fact:
<br/>
- I spent my first two years studying Mechanical Engineering because I was really interested in vehicle design
- I changed majors to CS because I admired the creativity that coding problems allowed for in the problem-solving process
